# Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly web-based application for managing bookmarks.

## Proposed Features and Functionality
### Planned Features for Bookmarking App

This document outlines potential features to add to the bookmarking application, aiming to improve its utility, usability, flexibility, and robustness. Each feature includes a brief description and notes on practicality and tradeoffs.

#### 1. Enhanced Tag Management

*   **Description:** Provide a dedicated interface to view all existing tags, see how many bookmarks are associated with each tag, and allow users to rename or delete tags globally.
*   **Practicality:** Relatively practical to implement. Requires backend endpoints for tag management and a frontend UI component.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Need to handle orphaned bookmarks if a tag is deleted. Renaming a tag affects all associated bookmarks.

#### 2. Folder/Collection System

*   **Description:** Implement a hierarchical structure (like folders or collections) to organize bookmarks in addition to or as an alternative to tags.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires changes to the data model (adding a 'folder' or 'collection' field, potentially with nesting), backend API, and significant frontend UI/UX work for drag-and-drop or selection-based organization.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Adds complexity to data querying and display. Users might prefer one system (tags vs. folders) over the other, or find managing both cumbersome.

#### 3. Advanced Filtering and Sorting

*   **Description:** Expand search capabilities to include filtering by multiple tags, filtering by date ranges (added or updated), and provide more sorting options (alphabetical by title/URL, by date, by frequency of access - if tracked).
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires modifications to the backend API to support more complex queries and frontend UI elements for filter/sort controls.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can increase query load on the database depending on implementation. UI can become cluttered with too many options.

#### 4. User Authentication and Sync

*   **Description:** Add user accounts to allow multiple users to use the application and sync bookmarks across different browsers or devices.
*   **Practicality:** High complexity. Requires implementing a full authentication system (user registration, login, sessions), securing API endpoints, and handling data synchronization logic.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Significant development effort and security considerations. Introduces the need for user management and potentially hosting infrastructure changes.

#### 5. Dedicated Browser Extension

*   **Description:** Develop browser extensions for popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to provide a more seamless way to add and access bookmarks directly from any webpage, potentially with context menus or toolbar popups.
*   **Practicality:** High complexity. Requires learning browser extension APIs for each target browser (though WebExtensions API helps standardize). Development and maintenance overhead for multiple browser platforms.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Requires separate development lifecycle from the main web app. Distribution through browser stores involves review processes.

#### 6. Rich Text Notes/Description

*   **Description:** Allow users to add formatted text (bold, italics, lists, links) or even images to the bookmark description or a dedicated notes field.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires integrating a rich text editor component in the frontend and storing formatted content (e.g., HTML or Markdown) in the database.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Increases storage size for descriptions. Need to consider how formatted content is displayed consistently across different views.

#### 7. Dead Link Checking

*   **Description:** Implement a feature to periodically check if bookmarked URLs are still valid and notify the user if a link is broken.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires a background process (server-side) to perform checks and a mechanism to display results to the user (e.g., marking broken links in the UI).
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can consume server resources and bandwidth depending on the number of bookmarks and check frequency. Need to handle rate limiting and potential blocking by websites.

#### 8. Bulk Editing and Deletion

*   **Description:** Allow users to select multiple bookmarks and perform actions like deleting them, adding/removing tags, or moving them to a folder in a single operation.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires implementing multi-select functionality in the frontend UI and backend API endpoints for bulk operations.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Need to carefully design the UI to prevent accidental bulk actions.
